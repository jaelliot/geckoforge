If this computer will **share** its keyboard/mouse:

1. Launch Synergy from app menu
2. Go to Settings â†’ Screen Layout
3. Drag client screens to position

## Firewall

The following ports are opened automatically:
- **24800** - Main Synergy connection
- **24802** - Background service
- **24804** - Background service

**Verify:**
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --list-ports
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Test server connectivity:**
```bash
ping <server-ip>
telnet <server-ip> 24800
```

**Restart client service:**
```bash
systemctl --user restart synergy-client
```

**Check firewall:**

### Wayland Issues

### License Activation

If license won't activate:
1. Check internet connection

3. Contact Synergy support: https://symless.com/contact

## Alternative: Input Leap

If you don't have a Synergy license, consider **Input Leap** (FOSS alternative):

```bash
flatpak install flathub io.github.input_leap.input-leap
```

Input Leap is free, has better Wayland support, and is compatible with Synergy server configurations.
