- Added comprehensive documentation and getting-started integration
- Built automated health monitoring and verification system
- Established comprehensive font configuration for development workflows

## Key Changes

### Files Created
- `home/modules/backup.nix` - Comprehensive rclone backup module with systemd automation, multi-strategy backups (critical/projects/infra), zero-knowledge encryption setup, and backup filters for DevOps workflows
- `scripts/setup-rclone.sh` - Interactive configuration wizard supporting Google Drive, AWS S3, Backblaze B2, OneDrive with guided encrypted remote creation and testing
- `scripts/check-backups.sh` - Health monitoring script with connectivity tests, service verification, backup/restore testing, and automated issue fixing
- `docs/backup-recovery.md` - Complete backup/recovery documentation covering setup, security model, manual operations, troubleshooting, and best practices

### Files Modified
- `home/home.nix` - Added backup.nix module import to enable rclone backup system
- `docs/getting-started.md` - Added comprehensive Step 10 for encrypted cloud backup setup with quick start guide and security overview
- `home/modules/desktop.nix` - Added comprehensive font configuration with Nerd Fonts (FiraCode, JetBrains Mono, Source Code Pro), system fonts (Liberation, DejaVu, Noto), and complete Kitty terminal setup with Gruvbox theme
- `profiles/leap-15.6/kde-nvidia/config.kiwi.xml` - Added system-level font packages (liberation-fonts, dejavu-fonts, noto-sans-fonts, noto-emoji-fonts, fontconfig)

## Architectural Decisions

### Backup System
- **Decision**: Use rclone with client-side encryption for zero-knowledge cloud backups
- **Rationale**: Provides security, multi-cloud support, and integration with systemd automation
- **Impact**: DevOps engineers get automated encrypted backups of critical infrastructure

- **Decision**: Implement 3-tier backup strategy (critical daily, projects weekly, infra monthly)
- **Rationale**: Balances backup frequency with storage costs and system load
- **Impact**: Critical files backed up frequently, less critical files on appropriate schedules

- **Decision**: Use systemd user services and timers for automation
- **Rationale**: Native Linux automation, no dependency on cron, user-level services
- **Impact**: Reliable automated backups that start with user session

### Font Configuration
- **Decision**: Use FiraCode Nerd Font as primary terminal/development font
- **Rationale**: Excellent programming ligatures, comprehensive symbol coverage, wide compatibility
- **Impact**: Better development experience with proper coding symbols and UI integration

- **Decision**: Include comprehensive font stack (Liberation, DejaVu, Noto, Ubuntu)
- **Rationale**: Ensures good fallback coverage for international text, emoji, and system UI
- **Impact**: Consistent text rendering across all applications and languages

- **Decision**: Configure Kitty terminal with Gruvbox Dark theme
- **Rationale**: Developer-friendly color scheme with good contrast and readability
- **Impact**: Comfortable terminal environment for extended development sessions

## System Features Implemented

### Backup System
#### Security Architecture
- **Zero-knowledge encryption**: AES-256 with dual-password system (encryption + salt)
- **Filename obfuscation**: File and directory names encrypted
- **Client-side encryption**: Data never leaves system unencrypted
- **Multi-cloud support**: Works with Google Drive, S3, B2, OneDrive

#### Backup Strategies
- **Critical Backup (Daily)**: SSH keys, GPG keys, AWS credentials, Kubernetes configs, documents
- **Projects Backup (Weekly)**: Git repositories, development workspaces, VS Code settings  
- **Infrastructure Backup (Monthly)**: Infrastructure as Code, Ansible playbooks, Terraform

#### Automation Features
- **Systemd timers**: Automated scheduling with proper dependency management
- **Health monitoring**: Automated verification of backups and remote connectivity
- **Comprehensive logging**: Structured logs with rotation and error tracking
- **Recovery testing**: Built-in backup/restore verification

#### DevOps Integration
- **Home-Manager integration**: Declarative configuration management
- **Filter customization**: Flexible include/exclude patterns for different workflows
- **Multi-provider support**: Easy switching between cloud providers
- **Performance optimization**: Configurable parallelism and compression

### Font & Terminal Configuration
#### Development-Focused Typography
- **Primary coding font**: FiraCode Nerd Font with programming ligatures and symbol support
- **Terminal environment**: Kitty with optimized font rendering and ligature support
- **Comprehensive font stack**: Liberation, DejaVu, Noto (including CJK and emoji support)
- **System integration**: Fontconfig management for consistent rendering

#### Visual Optimization
- **Color scheme**: Gruvbox Dark theme for comfortable extended development sessions
- **Font features**: Enabled coding ligatures and enhanced symbol rendering
- **Terminal features**: Transparency, padding, scrollback optimized for development workflows
- **Accessibility**: High contrast ratios and clear distinction between similar characters
- **Performance optimization**: Configurable parallelism and compression

## User Experience Enhancements
- **Interactive setup wizard**: Guided cloud provider configuration with testing
- **Health check automation**: One-command verification of entire backup system
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Complete setup, usage, and troubleshooting guides
- **Getting-started integration**: Seamless onboarding for new users

## Quality Assurance
- **Script validation**: All scripts made executable and follow bash best practices
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error checking and user-friendly messages
- **Documentation accuracy**: Step-by-step procedures tested and verified
