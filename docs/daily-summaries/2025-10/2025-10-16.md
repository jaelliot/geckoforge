# 2025-10-16 â€” geckoforge Session Summary

## Session Overview
**Date**: October 16, 2025
**Duration**: 3 hours
**Goals**: Deliver macOS-style keyboard workflow via Kanata across user setup and Home-Manager
**Status**: Completed

## Major Accomplishments
- Added Kanata-powered setup script with KDE and application shortcut alignment
- Introduced Home-Manager module for declarative macOS-style keyboard management
- Authored verification tooling and end-user guide for keyboard configuration

## Key Changes

### Files Created
- `scripts/setup-macos-keyboard.sh` - Installs Kanata, writes config, applies shortcuts, enables service
- `scripts/test-macos-keyboard.sh` - Verifies Kanata deployment, systemd user service, and app bindings
- `home/modules/macos-keyboard.nix` - Declarative Kanata config, service, and shortcut management
- `docs/guides/keyboard-configuration.md` - User guide for macOS-style keyboard workflow

### Files Modified
- `home/home.nix` - Imported macOS keyboard module
- `README.md` - Documented keyboard feature, guide, and quick-start step
- `scripts/firstrun-user.sh` - Pointed users at optional keyboard setup

### Files Deleted
- _None_

## Architectural Decisions
- **Decision**: Leverage Kanata as the canonical control/command remapper
- **Rationale**: Offers precise modifier swapping, integrates with systemd user service, and keeps configuration portable between manual scripts and Home-Manager
- **Impact**: New layer-3 script plus layer-4 module provide both imperative setup and declarative convergence

## Related Documentation
- `docs/guides/keyboard-configuration.md`
- `README.md`

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the Kanata service on physical hardware with multiple keyboards
- [ ] Evaluate inclusion of additional application profiles (JetBrains, LibreOffice)
- [ ] Consider integrating the setup script into `firstrun-user.sh` as optional prompt

## Blockers/Issues
- Need real hardware verification for `/dev/input` auto-detection edge cases
- Firefox profile detection may miss non-default installations

## Session Metadata
**Status**: Complete  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Next Action**: Hardware validation of Kanata workflow
