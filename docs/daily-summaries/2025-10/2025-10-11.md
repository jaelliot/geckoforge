# 2025-10-11 â€” Geckoforge Session Summary

## Session Overview
**Date**: October 11, 2025
**Duration**: 1 hour
**Goals**: Implement Synergy setup helper script for KVM switching
**Status**: Completed

## Major Accomplishments
- Created user-friendly Synergy setup helper script following Layer 3 principles
- Implemented interactive wizard that guides without forcing installation
- Added comprehensive documentation for KVM switching workflows
- Enhanced getting-started guide with optional Synergy configuration step

## Key Changes

### Files Created
- `scripts/setup-synergy.sh` - Interactive setup wizard for Synergy configuration with clear step-by-step prompts, firewall configuration, systemd service setup, and support for both client/server modes
- `docs/synergy-setup.md` - Complete documentation covering requirements, installation, configuration, troubleshooting, and Input Leap alternative

### Files Modified
- `docs/getting-started.md` - Added Step 10 for optional keyboard/mouse sharing with Synergy setup guidance

## Architectural Decisions
- **Decision**: Focus on Synergy (licensed software users already own) rather than pushing alternatives
- **Rationale**: Respects user investment and reduces cognitive load by focusing on their existing tools
- **Impact**: Clear, focused setup experience for users with Synergy licenses

- **Decision**: No automatic software installation - user must provide RPM file
- **Rationale**: Respects authentication requirements and user control over software installation
- **Impact**: Script only helps configure after user installs, following Layer 3 principles

- **Decision**: Interactive prompts with clear explanations at each step
- **Rationale**: Reduces cognitive load and makes process transparent to users
- **Impact**: Users understand what's happening and can troubleshoot issues

## System Features Implemented

### Synergy Setup Helper
#### User Experience
- **Interactive wizard**: Clear step-by-step prompts with obvious actions
- **No forced installation**: Script only helps and guides, doesn't install automatically
- **Mode detection**: Automatically configures client vs server mode based on user choice
- **Clear communication**: Reduced cognitive load with simple, direct language

#### Technical Configuration
- **Firewall management**: Automatically opens required ports (24800, 24802, 24804)
- **Systemd integration**: Creates user service for automatic client connection
- **RPM detection**: Finds and installs Synergy RPM from Downloads folder
- **Service validation**: Provides troubleshooting commands and status checks

#### Documentation Quality
- **Complete guide**: Installation, configuration, troubleshooting, alternatives
- **Clear requirements**: Synergy license and RPM download instructions
- **Troubleshooting section**: Common issues with Wayland, networking, licensing
- **Alternative options**: Mentions Input Leap for users without Synergy license

## Quality Assurance
- **Syntax validation**: Script passes bash syntax check without errors
- **Executable permissions**: Script properly marked as executable
- **Layer compliance**: Follows Geckoforge Layer 3 (User Setup) principles
- **Documentation parity**: Complete setup guide matches script functionality

## User Experience Enhancements
- **Reduced cognitive load**: Simple prompts, clear actions, obvious next steps
- **Respects user choice**: No automatic installation of unwanted software
- **Clear error messages**: Helpful guidance when requirements not met
- **Comprehensive help**: Links to official documentation and support

## Related Documentation
- Enhanced `docs/getting-started.md` with Synergy setup step
- Created `docs/synergy-setup.md` with complete configuration guide
- Script includes built-in help and troubleshooting guidance

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test script with actual Synergy RPM file
- [ ] Validate firewall configuration on fresh installation
- [ ] Test systemd service auto-start functionality
- [ ] Consider adding to firstrun-user.sh as optional component

âœ… **2025-10-11: Mystical Blue (Jux) Theme Integration** â€“ Implemented comprehensive theme system for KDE Plasma with all components integrated into ISO build process.

### Key Implementation Details
- **Layer 1 (ISO)**: Created KIWI overlay structure and copied all theme assets to `/usr/share/` system directories
- **Layer 3 (User Setup)**: Created `scripts/setup-jux-theme.sh` activation script with user confirmation and clear instructions
- **Layer 4 (Home-Manager)**: Created optional `home/modules/kde-theme.nix` for declarative theme configuration
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive `docs/themes.md` guide and updated `docs/getting-started.md` with theme activation step

### Files Created/Modified
- `themes/JuxTheme.colors` - Created missing KDE color scheme file
- `profiles/leap-15.6/kde-nvidia/root/usr/share/` - KIWI overlay structure with theme files
- `profiles/leap-15.6/kde-nvidia/config.kiwi.xml` - Added Kvantum packages and theme file references
- `scripts/setup-jux-theme.sh` - User-friendly theme activation script
- `home/modules/kde-theme.nix` - Optional declarative theme configuration
- `home/home.nix` - Added kde-theme module import
- `docs/themes.md` - Complete theme documentation
- `docs/getting-started.md` - Added Step 11 for theme activation

### Architecture Compliance
- **Layer 1**: Theme assets baked into ISO at build time
- **Layer 3**: User activation script with proper user interaction
- **Layer 4**: Optional declarative configuration via Home-Manager
- **Documentation**: Follows mandatory header guidance

### Validation Status
- âœ… Shell script syntax validated (`bash -n`)
- âœ… KIWI overlay structure verified (all theme files present)
- âœ… KIWI XML configuration updated (Kvantum packages + file references)
- âœ… Documentation follows header standards
- âœ… Getting-started guide updated with proper step numbering
- ðŸ”„ ISO build validation deferred (requires full KIWI build)

### Technical Implementation
- **Theme Components**: JuxDeco (window decorations), JuxPlasma (desktop theme), NoMansSkyJux (Qt theme), JuxTheme (color scheme)
- **Activation Methods**: Manual script, declarative Home-Manager, or manual KDE settings
- **User Experience**: Clear wizard with logout requirement explanation
- **Integration**: System-wide availability in every ISO build
