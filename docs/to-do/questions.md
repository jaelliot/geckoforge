Questions Before Proceeding

Profile variants: Do you want additional profiles (KDE, minimal, etc.) or just stick with GNOME-NVIDIA?
Home-Manager integration: Should the example home/ flake be part of geckoforge repo or separate?
Dotfiles: Move .vimrc, sway configs, etc. to a separate repo?
Testing rigor: How thoroughly do you want to test before v0.2.0? (VM-only vs. bare metal)
Release cadence: Monthly rebuilds to pick up Leap security updates?
